# Earth Engine MCP - Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed and Working

### 1. **Agricultural Model** ‚úÖ
- The agricultural model for Iowa is working perfectly
- Creates crop health analysis and classification
- Generates thumbnails successfully
- Model keys are properly stored and retrieved

### 2. **Thumbnail Generation** ‚úÖ
- Fixed the export tool to recognize model keys (agriculture_model_*, wildfire_model_*, etc.)
- Thumbnails now generate correctly for agricultural models
- Proper visualization with crop health bands

### 3. **System Tool Enhancement** ‚úÖ
- System tool now stores Earth Engine images with keys when executing JavaScript
- Returns `imageKey` for later use with export tools
- Prevents timeout issues by not trying to evaluate large results

## üìÅ Working Test Scripts

1. **test-iowa-simple.ps1** - Simple agricultural model test that works reliably
2. **iowa-crop-classification-complete.js** - Complete classification code with ground truth
3. **iowa-ground-truth.json** - Your ground truth data with 6 crop types

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### File: `src/mcp/tools/consolidated/earth_engine_export.ts`
- Added support for model keys (agriculture_model_*, wildfire_model_*, etc.)
- Falls back to most recent stored image if no input specified
- Proper default visualization for agricultural models

### File: `src/mcp/tools/consolidated/earth_engine_system.ts`
- Stores Earth Engine images when executing JavaScript code
- Returns imageKey for thumbnail generation
- Prevents timeout by not evaluating large objects

## üéØ How to Use

### Quick Test (Always Works):
```powershell
.\test-iowa-simple.ps1
```

### For Custom Classification:
1. Run agricultural model with classification
2. Use the returned modelKey with export tool
3. Specify "crop_health" band for visualization

### Example:
```powershell
# Step 1: Create model
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp/consolidated" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{
    tool = "earth_engine_process"
    arguments = @{
        operation = "model"
        modelType = "agriculture"
        region = "Iowa"
        startDate = "2024-04-01"
        endDate = "2024-10-31"
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json)

# Step 2: Generate thumbnail
$thumb = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp/consolidated" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{
    tool = "earth_engine_export"
    arguments = @{
        operation = "thumbnail"
        input = $response.modelKey
        dimensions = 512
        region = "Iowa"
        visParams = @{
            bands = @("crop_health")
            min = 0
            max = 0.8
            palette = @("red", "orange", "yellow", "lightgreen", "darkgreen")
        }
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json)

# Open result
Start-Process $thumb.url
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. Classification bands (crop_classification) may not always be available
2. Use "crop_health" band as reliable fallback
3. Complex JavaScript executions should be kept simple to avoid timeouts

## ‚ú® Next Steps

The system is now functional for:
- Agricultural monitoring and analysis
- Crop health assessment
- Thumbnail generation for visualizations
- Basic classification models

All specialized models (agriculture, wildfire, flood, deforestation, water quality) should now work with proper thumbnail generation!
