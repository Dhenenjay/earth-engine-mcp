# Earth Engine MCP Server - Global Shapefile Support Status

## üåç Implementation Summary

The Earth Engine MCP Server has been enhanced to support global shapefiles for international locations. The implementation uses the FAO GAUL 2015 dataset (Food and Agriculture Organization's Global Administrative Unit Layers) which provides administrative boundaries at three levels:

- **Level 0**: Countries
- **Level 1**: States/Provinces
- **Level 2**: Districts/Counties/Cities

## ‚úÖ Successfully Working Cities

| City | Country | Dataset Level | Area (km¬≤) | Notes |
|------|---------|---------------|------------|-------|
| **Paris** | France | District (Level 2) | 105 | Found directly in FAO GAUL |
| **Berlin** | Germany | District (Level 2) | 143 | Found directly in FAO GAUL |
| **Rome** | Italy | District (Level 2) | 5,362 | Found as "Roma" in FAO GAUL |
| **Cairo** | Egypt | State/Province (Level 1) | 2,904 | Cairo Governorate |
| **Singapore** | Singapore | Country (Level 0) | 597 | City-state |
| **Dubai** | UAE | State/Province (Level 1) | 4,070 | Dubai Emirate |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cities with Limited Support

These cities are not available as distinct administrative units in FAO GAUL 2015:

| City | Issue | Potential Solution |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Tokyo** | Not found in FAO GAUL as a distinct unit | May be part of larger Tokyo Metropolis |
| **Mumbai** | Not found with current mappings | Needs exact district name from FAO GAUL |
| **London** | "Greater London" not in FAO GAUL | May need UK-specific dataset |
| **Sydney** | Australian cities not in FAO GAUL Level 2 | Need Australian-specific boundaries |
| **S√£o Paulo** | Encoding issues with Portuguese characters | May need exact spelling from FAO GAUL |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified

1. **`src/mcp/tools/shapefile_to_geometry.ts`**
   - Added comprehensive global city mappings
   - Implemented multi-level search strategy (Level 2 ‚Üí Level 1 ‚Üí Level 0)
   - Added alternate name support for cities with multiple names
   - Enhanced error handling with debug logging

2. **`src/utils/geometry-cache.ts`**
   - Updated with global city aliases
   - Added support for international city nicknames

3. **`app/api/mcp/sse/route.ts`**
   - Handles SSE endpoint requests for Claude Desktop integration

### Search Strategy

```javascript
1. Search FAO GAUL Level 2 (Districts/Cities)
   - Try mapped name with country filter
   - Try alternate names if provided
   - Try without country filter

2. Fallback to Level 1 (States/Provinces)
   - For cities that are also administrative regions
   - Try mapped name with country filter
   - Try alternate names

3. Fallback to Level 0 (Countries)
   - For city-states like Singapore
```

## üìä Coverage Statistics

- **Total cities mapped**: 50+ major global cities
- **Success rate with FAO GAUL**: ~40%
- **Regions covered**: Europe, Asia, Americas, Africa, Oceania

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Working Example - Paris
```json
{
  "tool": "convert_place_to_shapefile_geometry",
  "arguments": {
    "placeName": "Paris"
  }
}
// Returns: 105 km¬≤ boundary from FAO GAUL Level 2
```

### Working Example - Singapore
```json
{
  "tool": "convert_place_to_shapefile_geometry",
  "arguments": {
    "placeName": "Singapore"
  }
}
// Returns: 597 km¬≤ boundary from FAO GAUL Level 0 (Country)
```

## üîÆ Future Improvements

1. **Additional Datasets**
   - Natural Earth for better city coverage
   - OpenStreetMap boundaries for missing cities
   - Country-specific datasets (e.g., US Census TIGER for US cities)

2. **Enhanced Matching**
   - Fuzzy string matching for city names
   - Multi-language support (e.g., Êù±‰∫¨ for Tokyo)
   - Better handling of diacritics and special characters

3. **Caching and Performance**
   - Pre-load common city boundaries
   - Implement persistent cache across server restarts

4. **Error Handling**
   - Provide suggestions for alternative names
   - Return nearest matching boundary when exact match fails

## üìù Notes for Developers

- FAO GAUL 2015 is comprehensive for countries and states but limited for cities
- Many major cities are administrative regions (Level 1) rather than districts (Level 2)
- Some cities may be split across multiple districts in FAO GAUL
- Consider using bounding boxes as fallback for unsupported cities

## üåê Server Configuration

The server runs on `http://localhost:3000` with the SSE endpoint at `/api/mcp/sse`

For Claude Desktop integration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "earth-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-earth-engine"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:3000/sse"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ú® Summary

The global shapefile support is partially successful, with good coverage for European cities, some Asian cities, and city-states. The main limitation is the FAO GAUL dataset's city coverage. For production use, consider integrating additional datasets or using geocoding APIs as fallbacks for unsupported locations.
